# Frontend-Application

Hello Everyone! This is a Frontend Application which updates the prices of the various housing structures which is transparent to our consumers so that they can make an informed decision. Here I am making a page or main components for one of such a pricing plan structure.

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Landing Page:

This page has a header which has the 5 different categories of prices of houses that we can look out for. All these categories have 3 different plans mentioned below it which updates the 'prices' and 'total amount of plan' on every category and the consumer can chooses whichever plan suits them.

By Default, the category that is chosen is $300k-$400k but if the user updates the category and if refreshes the page the category remains the same what the consumer has chosen, it doesnâ€™t go back to default.

Modal Page:
Modal is launched when the consumer clicks on Start your trial/Get in Touch and it consists of all the information that is required. When you enter and submit the information an alert goes with all the information consumer just updated in the modal. It is also connected by the Qualified category with which pricing plan the user is buying is updated in the modal.

No internet Page:
This page comes up when there is no internet connection.
